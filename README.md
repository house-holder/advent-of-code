# Advent of Code
My main repo for tracking work on all Advent of Code puzzles. I use them to increase my (hobbyist-level) coding proficiency, and thus the attempts are likely to be amateurish or inefficient.

I've also included a `stats.json` file, generated by a custom script that I use to track my time spent on each problem.

Mostly working in Go, but plans are to continue to expand into other languages like Rust,Zig, C#... Perhaps even JS/TS or other more obscure things like Odin, Ocaml, etc.
